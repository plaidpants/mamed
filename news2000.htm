      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A little early holiday present. I have
      ported an MP3 player for the Kodak DC220, DC260, DC265 &amp;
      DC290, no other cameras are supported at this time. Currently
      it has a very simple interface (i.e. almost none) and the sound
      quality can be improved but it is a start. The HW supports 11Khz
      15 bit mono so don't expect miracles. Special thanks to Ken Lamarche
      for doing the initial port to Digita. The source code is based
      on the open source MP3 player <A HREF="http://www.freeamp.org/">FreeAmp</A>
      available for DOS and Linux. You can download the binary and

      Should make using the camera to play games much less frustrating.
      I also added a speed up hack that can be enabled in the first
      menu. It reduces the number of CPU context switches to only one
      per frame, because some drivers have this set parameter way too
      high. This will only work with some of the drivers with multiple
      CPU's, some may crash, but for the few that it does work for
      you should notice a dramatic speed increase. Check out games

      skip by default but I limit it to a maximum of 9 since anything
      above that is pretty much unplayable, you can still set it higher
      manually. I added a performance graph to the <A HREF="reviews.htm">camera
      info page</A> based on my experiments so you can compare the

      should be able to find the firmware updater <A HREF="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/service/software/dc290/navigation.shtml">here</A>

      core sound code is much better and faster than the XMAME sound
      code I was using to mix the multiple channels, you should notice
      the improvement immediately. I also rewrote my Kodak sound code
      for better performance and quality.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Third, this release is much faster in general,

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I've also posted a new version of Multipac
      for Digita that works on both the <A HREF="http://www.minoltausa.com/mainframe.asp?productID=200&whichProductSection=1&">Minolta
      Dimage 1500 EX</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/photosmart/products/cameras/c500.html">HP
      C500 Photosmart</A> based on the <A HREF="http://www.lsil.com/products/dcam/index.html">DCAM
      processor</A>. I even updated the Kodak version to work on the
      <A HREF="http://www.kodak.com/US/en/digital/cameras/dc220/index.shtml">DC220</A>,
      <A HREF="http://www.kodak.com/US/en/digital/cameras/dc260/index.shtml">DC260</A>,
      <A HREF="http://www.kodak.com/US/en/digital/cameras/dc265/index.shtml">DC265</A>
      and <A HREF="http://www.kodak.com/US/en/digital/cameras/dc290/index.shtml">DC290</A>
      as well. All shipping Digita cameras in one source code base!!!
      It will even work on the <A HREF="http://www.minoltausa.com/mainframe.asp?productID=456&whichProductSection=1&whichSection=">Minolta
      3D 1500</A>, but that costs $5000 so it's kind of expensive.
      I didn't add the sound to the Kodak's though and the Minolta
      and HP camera don't really have sound, sorry. MAMED and MESSD
      to come but it might be a little while.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I have multipac working on the HP C500,
      I will get the Minolta Dimage 1500 EX working next. It's a little
      slow right now but hopefully I can speed it up, I'll post it
      soon. After that it's time for the big MAME &amp; MESS port.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">MAMED and MESSD version 36b15 is now available
      for the Kodak DC220, DC260, DC265, and DC290 (ALL KODAK DIGITA
      OS CAMERAS!!!). Each is available in two versions, a dynamic
      linking versions with all drivers included and an all in one
      version that contains as many drivers as I could fit into a single
      object that loaded on the DC290. Please read the readme for new
      information about using MESS for Digita. ( I guess I need to
      add MESS for Digita to the banner above) MESS for Digita works
      great for some of the emulated console systems but is kind of
      hard to operate for the emulated computer system, i.e. cameras
      don't have keyboards, so don't complain if you can't type. Also,
      DC290 key response should be improved in this version. Speed
      also seems to also be improving due to the hard work of the MAME
      developer team.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Kodak has lowered their prices on the many
      of their digital cameras including the DC290. Remember MAME and
      MESS for Digita only run on Digita enabled digital camera, not
      all of Kodak's digital cameras contain Digita OS.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Just a little update. I now have the MESS
      code working so I guess MESS for Digita or MESSD will soon be
      a reality, the UI will be simplistic for the moment. Also for
      the next release I will include an all-in-one build without the
      dynamic linking stuff for those of you who own DC290s, the dynamic
      linking stuff doesn't work right on the DC290 for some reason,
      just like the sound. I also have received Digita OS for MIPS
      beta so I will try and have a release for the HP C500 and Minolta
      Dimage 1500 EX cameras soon, I'll need to get my hands on these
      cameras next.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">MAMED version 36b14b is now available,
      it is very different than pervious versions so please read the
      README. This version DOES NOT work on the DC290 (sorry) however
      it will now work on the DC220, DC260 and DC265!!! This version
      includes and supports almost every game except neogeo and the
      large ROM games, cause there's just not enough RAM for everything
      whatever I do. All game, sound, and cpu drivers are includes
      as separate files in directories on the compact flash. They are
      loaded and then linked at runtime and you can adjust which game,
      cpu and sound drivers are loaded by moving the driver files in
      and out of the directories manually. Those of you with large
      compact flash cards will be happy you have them now. I also improved
      the speed of the sound driver considerably by replacing all floating
      point with fixed point math. The XMAME and XMESS people should
      take note of the changes I made to their sound code. I disabled
      the autokey menu for the moment.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">On the news front, MAMED was mentioned
      this past month in two top German computer magazines &quot;Computer
      Bild&quot; and &quot;Chip&quot;, thanks Olivier for the info.
      Also MAMED will be mentioned in an upcoming &quot;<A HREF="http://www.acbm.com/">Pocket</A>&quot;
      magazine. And Finally, &quot;<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</A>&quot;
      magazine will be doing a feature on cool digital devices like
      MAMED next month.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also, info from the author of HiVE in some
      recent interviews means all you Windows CE devices owners may
      be able to play classic arcade games soon. I also received word
      from someone else that the full MAME for Windows CE may not be
      far behind.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I also had a good time and picked up lots
      of cool freebies at the Kodak Developers Conference this past
      week, mostly talk about photo meta data and scripts though. It
      was nice seeing everyone at MacWorld too.</FONT></P>
