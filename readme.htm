    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">1. How to install MAME or MESS for Digita:</FONT></B><FONT
     FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
    On the DC290 you need at least version 1.0.4 of the camera firmware.
    You can download it from Kodak's web site <A HREF="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/service/software/dc290/navigation.shtml">here</A>
    if you need to.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Put the mini MAMED.CAM or MESSD.CAM file
    and the MAME or MESS directory in the system folder of the compact
    flash. Please enable only the cpu, sound, and game or system
    drivers you are actually going to use because there is not enough
    memory to load them all. You can enabled or disable them by moving
    them in and out of their respective folders or by using the driver
    selection menu. On the DC220 you have very little RAM so you
    must load only one or two drivers at a time. I have included
    some separated drivers just in case you need to reduce memory
    requirements.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">It's a lot of relocatable object code so
    you will probably need at least a 15MB card.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now, put a Roms Folder in the System folder
    with all the roms inside you wish to use. Leave the game and
    system roms zipped the program will uncompress them for you.
    MESS system image files (carts, disks, etc.) must be uncompressed
    and have the correct file extensions in order to load them. The
    MESS filemanager defaults to a folder inside the roms folder
    with the same name as the system you are running.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Some people have reported problems using
    the Kodak USB camera mounting software to put the files and folders
    inside the System folder. You can use a card reader or laptop
    with a PCMCIA slot to mount the card and put files and folders
    on the compact flash card directly. Game ROM files can be in
    the System Folder with this version. Some people have reported
    sucess by dragging the completed folder to the mounted camera
    instead of creating one in the explorer window. Others have reported
    success using a script to make a folders. You could also unzip
    the file directly in the explorer window on the mounted camera
    as this appears to work as well. Macintosh uses need to use a
    card reader cause Kodak doesn't supply camera mounting software
    for the Macintosh.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Currently MAMED and MESSD supports almost
    all of the game and systems supported by MAME and MESS. But you
    cannot load all the game, system, sound and cpu drivers at once
    and still have enough RAM to actually run any of the games or
    systems, except for maybe pacman. Some games and systems take
    too much RAM to run anyways. The MESS drivers are new and just
    becoming stable so expect some problems using some of the MESSD
    systems.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A few of the sound and cpu drivers are
    required by many other drivers and are contained in the main
    mame.o and mess.o driver files and so do not appear as separate
    files in the driver folders. If a game or system will not run
    it may not have the required sound or cpu drivers, or it might
    just require too much RAM. I mark drivers that don't have all
    modules loaded correctly with ALL CAPS. You may be able to get
    some larger games and systems to run by reducing the number of
    game, system, sound and cpu drivers being loaded. Do not mix
    MAMED and MESSD driver files as they were compiled differently.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">You might want to learn how to use MAMED
    &amp; MESSD by first using MAME and MESS on your PC. You can
    experiment with operating the emulators a little more easily
    than you can inside the camera. I suggest running the emulator
    on the PC to figure out which cpu, sound, and system drivers
    are required, these appear on the first screen.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Kodak cameras have a PPC 823 running
    a 66Mhz. It's about like a Powermac6100/66 but without a big
    processor cache. So expect the older games and systems to run
    well but the newer games and systems to run a bit sluggish. I
    get about 100% full speed with 20fps (every third frame) with
    sound on a DC290 playing Pacman. Most games are still very playable
    even when running at only 50% speed.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">2. How to operate MAME and MESS for
    Digita inside the camera:</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Launch the MAMED.CAM or MESSD.CAM alternate
    application from the applications menu in review mode menu in
    the Digita UI. It's all the way to the right so you have to scroll
    right one extra time to see this menu.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">You can also rename the MAMED.CAM or MESSD.CAM
    application DEFAULT.CAM and it will launch when the camera is
    powered on and this flash card is inserted. (I run it this way
    since there isn't much room for pictures after I put a bunch
    of roms on the card)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Wait a while for it to load, load time
    is dependent on the number of drivers you are loading.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The main menu comes up and uses the built
    in MAME UI to display a list a MAME or MESS drivers built into
    this build and exist as roms on the compact flash. If no roms
    are found the list will be empty. When system/game drivers do
    not have all the correct cpu and sound driver modules enabled
    I display it with ALL CAPS and will not allow it to be run.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Use the up and down to scroll through the
    list. Left and Right will page up and down. Select the game or
    system you want to run by pressing the display button. This button
    is mapped to &lt;enter&gt;. If all goes well you will see the
    standard MAME/MESS warning and copyright page.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">MESSD will present an addition menu to
    allow you to select system image files for use with the previously
    selected system. The type of the file is determined by the file
    extension so you must have your image files named correctly and
    they cannot be compressed. You can select as many system image
    files as you want when you are done select the blank line to
    continue. MESSD now has a built in file manager menu which will
    allow you to select any type of image anywhere on the card after
    loading the machine. I may remove my menu since this one is much
    nicer.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">You can also access the game and system
    options menu by pressing the menu key while the game or system
    list is displayed and before a game or system is run. You can
    change an option by scrolling up and down and pressing the display
    button to change the selected option. Return to the game or system
    list by pressing the center softkey or the menu button again.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The driver module selection screen can
    be accessed by pressing the record button or the left softkey
    from the driver/system list. This will cycle through the game/system,
    cpu, and sound driver modules that are found in the enabled and
    disabled directories. use up and down to select and file and
    by pressing the overlay button will move the files in and out
    of the directories. Remember not to enable too many files or
    there will not be enough RAM to run the application.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Game or System options:<BR>
    -Pad Orientation<BR>
    Allows you to select which way is up with regards to the directional
    pad. It only is active when the game or system is running. The
    game or system select menu is alway orientated normally.<BR>
    -Resolution<BR>
    Allows you to select between low, medium, and high resolution.
    This is useful to be able to play games like rampage which use
    a high resolution screen. It is also useful to have enough pixels
    to display games rotated vertically and still be able to see
    all the pixels. You can use this feature when you connect the
    camera to a TV or monitor so you don't have to rotate it. The
    low resolution is good for Gamegear and gameboy which don't have
    much resolution. Note: I have yet to get any gameboy games to
    run yet, this driver is new.<BR>
    -No Rotation<BR>
    -Rotation Right<BR>
    -Rotation Left<BR>
    -Flip X<BR>
    -Flip Y<BR>
    These are all MAME options for display to adjust which way is
    up for game and system graphics. You can experiment to find which
    option works best for you for which game or system.<BR>
    -Sound<BR>
    This enables sound MAME, but it can be disabled with the fake
    sound option.<BR>
    -Samples<BR>
    This enables sound samples that are required for some ROMs. Place
    the samples in the samples folder inside the system folder. This
    can be disabled by the fake sound option.<BR>
    -Fake Sound<BR>
    This disables sound at the low level so MAME can think sound
    is running. Some ROMs require sound to be enabled to operate
    properly. This can be used to disable sound without affecting
    these ROMs.<BR>
    -Artwork<BR>
    Just put the artwork files in the artwork directory.<BR>
    -CPU Slice Speedup<BR>
    Some game drivers have exceeding high number of CPU context switches
    when they really don't require so many. This option reduces the
    number of context switches to exactly 1 per frame. This may not
    work on some driver and may crash others but on the few it does
    work on you can expect a dramatic speed boost. (try Xevious,
    Dig Dug and Galaga for example)<BR>
    -Auto Rotate<BR>
    Detect the orientation of the game and rotate the screen and
    directional to match.<BR>
    -Dirty Rects<BR>
    Dirty rects option allows the video code to only update the parts
    of the screen that have changed and can improve video performance.
    You can force this option on or off or only turn it on for drivers
    that support dirty rects.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">After you select a game or system with
    the display button, press left and right to press 'OK'. Since
    there are no 'O' or 'K' buttons on the camera. Then the info
    screen will appear and you can press and key to start the game
    or system. Note: if you rotated the directional pad you will
    have to press left and right in the new direction.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To stop the game or system and go back
    to the main game or system list press the middle softkey. This
    is mapped to &lt;esc&gt;.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I would suggest adjusting the direction
    buttons before playing a game or system since it may be rotated.
    Do this from the MAME menu under adjust keys or before you start
    the game or system with the pad orientation setting. Good thing
    it's easy to rotate the monitor on a digital camera. If only
    I could do that on my full sized Xevious game.</FONT></P>
