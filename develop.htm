    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Basically Digita OS alternate applications
    &quot;.CAM files&quot; are nothing more than unresolved relocatable
    object files with an entry() function. Digita OS uses the vxWorks
    loadModule() function to load and link the application object
    file at runtime with the OS. You don't have to include any OS
    dependant functions like printf() in you object, just a reference
    to it, Digita will link everything at runtime. Digita then looks
    up the reference to entry in the object file and calls it, thus
    launching the alternate application.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Each platform uses different object files
    but the Kodak DC220, DC260, DC265, and DC290 use the vxWorks
    powerpc arch with elf object files configured for the PPC860.
    The Dimage 1500EX uses the vxWorks MIPS arch with elf files configured
    for the CW4000. Flashpoint will be releasing shortly a new alternate
    application SDK for Digita which includes the vxWorks enviroment
    for the PC along with a special version of Digita that can be
    loaded on the Kodak DC290 to allow source level debugging.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you are just looking to experiment a
    bit you could probably get by with just the GNU compiler configured
    for powerpc-elf. Just create an unresolved object file with an
    entry() function, rename it .cam something and put it on the
    San Disk in the system folder. Most of the standard &quot;C&quot;
    library function are availible, you can also learn a lot from
    looking at my code. If you succeed in getting anything to work
    let me know I'd be interested in hearing about it. Several people
    have contacted my about stuff they have gotten working on their
    cameras.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here is a <A HREF="http://graphics.lcs.mit.edu/~aisaksen/projects/cameras/kodak/gcc.html">web
    site</A> that describes exactly how to build GCC as a cross compiler
    that works with kodak Digita cameras. He was even able to compile
    and run the current version of Multipac on his DC260 camera.
    Everything he used to build the development system was freely
    avaible on the internet. You should be able to build basic applications
    for the camera that use the compact flash, buttons, and LCD by
    using the current Mulitpac source code availible on this web
    site. You can download a Windows version of GCC for PPC <A HREF="Crossgcc.zip">here</A>
    (26MB) that will work for the multipac source.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A small debugging application that activates
    the internal vxWorks debugger inside the camera and allows interaction
    through the serial port. Just connect HyperTerm or other termial
    program via a serial cable to a DC290 camera (DC290 camera only).
    Put Shellapp.cam in your system folder on your compact flash
    card. Then put the application you wish to debug on the card
    too and name it test.cam. Run Shellapp.cam and it will load your
    test application and suspend the task just before executing it.
    From the serial port shell type &quot;tr 0x00000000&quot; using
    the actual task ID of the alternate application to start your
    application running so you can debug (type &quot;i&quot; to get
    a list of task ID's). You can type help from the shell to get
    information about all the debugging commands available. You can
    set break points and all sorts of goodies. I rename Shellapp.cam
    to default.cam so it always loads at start for faster turn around
    time while debugging.</FONT></P>
