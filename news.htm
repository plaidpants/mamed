        I reconstucted the site here for the moment so people interested can use the site. Some of the old forum posts are available in the internet archive

It uses a Kodak DC290 as its brains and doomd. Great way to recycled an old digital camera.

        Sorry the site is difficult to access lately, to access this site you need to disable compression support in the browser. In Firefox go to about:config and then to network.http.accept-encoding and temporarily clear the string, reset it to defaults when done. Sorry for all the trouble.

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I put back the pacman emulators and source
        code. I never did get much of a response from these people (probably
        just an automated response system) so I am not really sure what
        caused their automated spider to flag files on this site. I re-zipped
        one of the files to remove some empty directories, hopefully
        that was it. As for the DCMA please support groups like the <A
        HREF="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</A> and <A HREF="http://www.chillingeffects.org/">chillingeffects.org</A>
        and write your representatives and let them know how much trouble
        this law is causing people and it's unintended consequences.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I had to remove the pacman emulators due
        to a <A HREF="dcma.txt">DCMA Takedown notice</A> sent to my ISP.
        Although no pacman roms are available on this site certain filename
        place holders contained in the emulator archives on this site
        probably triggered a web crawler. Although Nintendo does seem
        to believe that all emulators are illegal. <A HREF="dcmareply.txt">Hopefully
        I can get things restored soon</A>.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Sorry for the lack of updates but this
        is just a hobby after all. Speaking of hobbies I spent some time
        in San Francisco recently at the recent battlebots competition.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">First, another programmable camera has
        been discovered and someone is working on hacking it to maybe
        one day run MAME. You can read the post <A HREF="http://digita.mame.net/cgi-bin/wwwthreads/showpost.pl?Board=digitagames&Number=99&page=0&view=expanded&mode=threaded&sb=7#Post99">here</A>
        and go to his web site <A HREF="http://www.darkskiez.co.uk/digital.html">here</A>.
        If anyone has one of these cameras and want to help out I'm sure
        he would appreciate it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also since the demise of the flashpoint
        website you can still find some digita information at the Digita
        World site <A HREF="http://www.csd.net/~cgadd/digita/index.html">here</A>.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">There have been some new versions of MAME
        available for the dreamcast floating about recently. Sesei has
        done some amazing working figuring out the mame core and the
        MAMED and mamedc dreamcast ports to make his own port of MAME.
        You can download his CP1MAME37b16 version <A HREF="http://siseinohito.tripod.co.jp/">here</A>.
        He has some source and other info available but that part of
        his web site appears to be missing right now and he has deleted
        his posts from the message boards. Hopefully we will see it return
        soon. Everyone please be nice to each other and work together
        a little.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Others have used this Sesei code to create
        several other versions of MAME. You can check out warmtoe site
        <A HREF="http://www.fantastic-sites.com/warmtoe/">here</A> for
        more info on his version. WarmToe was recently able to recode
        the mame sound code driver to directly access the dreamcast sound
        HW and should allow for much faster sound emulation. He has been
        currently working on a Williams version called MAIM. There is
        also some information on some other ports <A HREF="http://dev.dcemulation.com/mamed/">here</A>
        at the Unofficial MAMED American Website.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also the original MAMED compatibility site
        seems to has disappeared, Quicksilver was kind enough to send
        me the tables &amp; scripts from the site so they are not lost.
        I will try and host them here when I get a chance. In the meantime
        you can check out a new different compatibility site <A HREF="http://www.chez.com/omc1/MAMED/Index.htm">here</A>,
        thanks to droogieboy for pointing it out to me and emuxer for
        creating it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Kudos for everyone working on making some
        new versions of the MAME that runs on the dreamcast.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Finally I added to the download page a
        37b6.5 version of MAMED for download. This is an older mame core
        which seemed to run some games which the 37b15 did not want to
        run. However this version has the updated UI core from the 37b15.5
        version. I built and tested this a long time ago but never got
        around to uploading it, please let me know if it works, if it
        doesn't I just remove it. Also a reuploaded the original b37.15
        cdi image with the rar recovery record so hopefully people will
        be able to repair a bad download, maybe I should split it and
        have par files.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
