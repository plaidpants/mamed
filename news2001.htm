      to yesterday's release, it fixes two things. The sound drivers
      should be working in all games now, even if some of them sound
      realy sloooow. Second, since the mame core slows down a lot for
      certain games when it's given several joysticks, I have removed
      the separate joystick support. All joystick stuff maps again
      to the keyboard, four joysticks are supported, just not as joysticks
      as far as the mame core is concerned. So the button mapping has
      changed yet again, sorry for any trouble.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">MAMED beta 4 is ready and available on
      the downloads <A HREF="download.htm">page</A>. It's based on
      the fairly up to date mame37b15 source code base. The latest
      mame core removes 8-bit support so I probably will not update
      to that, because some games will run out of memory in 16-bit
      mode. The 68K cpu emulation should be fixed however some sound
      drivers still appear to not work, outzone for one. Be sure to
      turn off sound in those games or memory corruption could occur.
      Hopefully I can fix it next time around. There is a memory gauge
      built into the options menu so you can see how much memory is
      being used for certain games. Memory is very tight in some larger
      games, some will not even run if you use hyper's menu and the
      pack must be run directly from kosh or boot.rc, outzone again
      is one of those. I modified hyper's menu for the extra pack 16
      &amp; neomamed, the menu will also wrap now. You can also exit
      back to hyper's menu from each pack, this cleans up any memory
      fragmentation that has occured while running a particular pack.
      There is also an option to hide clones which is nice to clean
      up the game list a little. Fake sound also works now. Many games
      that didn't work before should work now. Also four controllers
      are supported the first one controls the menus, the buttons changed
      a bit because the joysticks are supported as true joysticks (with
      analog support) instead of mapping to the keyboard, you still
      don't need a keyboard to play. Have fun.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A little update to keep everyone happy.
      Food fight is running along with neogeo games joyjoy &amp; puzzled
      which means 68K stuff is working, a little slowly right now as
      I have MAMEDBG turned on. I have more work to do though, the
      68K cpu instruction cycles table is not correct for some reason
      (lot's of zero's and big numbers so I hacked it to always be
      10 cycles per instruction for the moment), I don't know if it's
      getting trashed or isn't created correctly in the first place,
      I'm investigating. I have identified about 10 blocks (32K) of
      memory that are not getting freed after running a game, which
      leads to memory fragmentation, really need to track that down
      where those occur so it doesn't stop working after playing 10
      games or so. There seem to be some random occurances of memory
      corruption as well that show up more frequently when I put printf()
      in the code, could be a KOS thing or something in my stuff. I
      did track down one memory corruption thing occuring in my palette
      table code which I fixed. If there are any other CPUs that exhibit
      the same behavior as the 68K did, black screen but menus work
      and you can return to the game list, I'd like to hear about it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also about memory use, after running on
      one of the above neogeo games the maximum total memory allocation
      was 7,571,216 bytes. To run just pacman required 2,276,748 bytes.
      This is in addition to KOS and the MAMED application code. Just
      to give everyone an idea of the memory overhead for display buffers,
      graphic tiles, roms, cpu ram, cpu tables, etc. required to run
      a MAME game. So even if the rom is only 9MB uncompressed doesn't
      mean it's going to run, there are a lot of other things that
      require RAM. In the future I might be able to swap ROM's in an
      out of RAM and allow loading of much larger games but for the
      moment don't expect really large games to run. Just letting you
      know so you don't get your hopes up too high.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Oh, and one more thing, outzone runs really
      well for a little while but no sound yet.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">For starters here is a sneak peak at MESSD
      running on the dreamcast. It's going to take a little while to
      get it all working because it requires fairly complete set of
      directory scanning functions to load roms and stuff and KOS is
      a little lacking in that support.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Second, I've figured out what's up with
      the 68K emulator in my version of MAMED. The particular MAME
      code release it's based on is 37b6 and that version had a little
      trouble with endianess for the C version of the 68K emulator
      but it has since been fixed. I took a look and tried to hack
      some pieces together to get it to run correctly on the dreamcast
      but no luck. I'm going to have to update my source code base
      to the current version to fix the problem (lucky Christophe)
      and that's going to take a little while but I've done it many
      times and most times I don't break the code too much doing the
      merge. 8 bit graphics support is going away in MAME and I might
      want to keep that cause it reduces the amount of RAM required
      to run certain games so I might not go all the way to the latest
      version.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">So here is a new release of MAMED without
      the 68K emulator to save a little RAM. What new you ask, well....</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Fixed floating point calculations, fixes
      some sound emulation and vector games and background png image
      loading. Games which use the 68K are marked with all CAPS, cause
      the 68K cpu isn't in this release (saves about 1MB or RAM). If
      you select a game and it doesn't run you selected a game that
      uses 68K, you ran out of RAM, you don't have the correct rom
      set for MAME core 37b6, you selected a clone rom set and you
      don't have the parent set on the same CD. If a game doesn't have
      correct sound you might need samples, some games that don't require
      samples now did require them for this older version of the MAME
      core. I now support both 8 &amp; 16 bit graphics modes. In 16
      bit, if possible I avoid using lookup tables and use direct copy
      which is much faster (BTW the compiler lib built-in memcpy()
      is way slow, avoid in your own stuff if possible). Use 8-bit
      for larger games that require more memory. I also added an new
      graphics mode that tries to scale a little better. You can run
      MAMED from the command line with a rom name argument to create
      a self boot single game CD if you wish. Rescanning of the CD
      is only done when you select &quot;RESCAN&quot;. You can put
      a snap directory on the CD and the png file corresponding to
      the rom name is displayed in the background in the game list
      menu (looks really nice BTW). There is preliminary support for
      a config file on the CD called MAME.CFG you can use it if you
      like. Overall stability should be improved and many more games
      that didn't run before should run now. If you screw up your boot
      disk but do manage to get KOS on there I will run KOSH which
      is built into the KOS image in /rd. And finally the X &amp; B
      buttons are swapped from the last release.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Know MAMED problems</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">68K emulation doesn't work, duh? Sometimes
      sound startup and shutdown is not in sync with the HW and can
      cause the Dreamcast to reset, I'm looking into it, can cause
      some games to fail at startup or shutdown at random. There are
      a few games that should work that don't, playchoice10 comes to
      mind, I'm working on it. Cheat, History, Hiscore, Mameinfo are
      not working, don't even try and put the file on the CD. Memory
      fragmentation needs to be improved to avoid crashes and allow
      switching to other packs.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">KOS changes</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Increased the iso9660 disk cache from 32K
      to 128K (should hold any size rom disk you stick in, I might
      reduce it a bit in the future but I have room for the moment).
      Memory allocation that fails no longer reset the dreamcast (the
      MAME source code is pretty good and can recover correctly from
      out of memory conditions). Memory can still get fragmented after
      using MAMED for a while and cause out of memory conditions and
      even crashes. I also adjusted the stack ceiling from 64K to 128K
      to avoid stack overflow problems.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The CD swap bug has been fixed. Turned
      out to be a single character in the KOS iso9660 driver (uint32
      changed to int32) for those that want to know. So now you need
      my special version of KOS to run MAMED on your dreamcast, although
      this version should run any standard KOS application without
      problems. I've included the standard KOS boot script support
      in this special version so you can change which mamed.klf gets
      run of a CD or so you can run some kind of KOS menu application
      to select one. Disk swapping should not cause any problems, to
      refresh the screen just try and load something that's not on
      the disk by pressing start from the game list and it will rescan
      the CD correctly. You can download the plain files <A HREF="mamedkos.zip">here</A>.
      Just be sure to edit the boot.rc file to run the version of mamed.klf
      you want. I've also embedded the stream.drv in the /rd inside
      KOS so you don't need it on the CD anymore.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">OK now on to the MAMED packs. All cpu and
      sound drivers are inside in each pack so they will be too big
      to load onto /rd and run it from there so they must be on a CD
      to run preferably the CD with KOS above. All MAME drivers are
      included and separated by manufacture groups but not all will
      run because of memory constraints. I tried to make all the packs
      about the same size (~5MB). I can fairly easily make special
      builds to run a particular game with only the bare minimum of
      code but I will work on that later. Remember the uncompressed
      rom size is important but also each driver has to emulate ram
      chips inside the machine too so don't expect a rom that uncompresses
      to 14.6MB to run on the dreamcast you need space for ram chips
      and the emulator code and even then it might be just too slow.
      Also remember this is based on MAME v37b6 not the latest and
      some rom have changed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">These are big files so don't just go downloading
      all of them at once. Download one with the KOS above and give
      it a try first. Please let me know if they work, the last beta
      build was diffcult for most people. This one should be much easier
      to get working. I'll get around to packaging up the source when
      I get a chance and hopefully others can make some selfboot images,
      I'm no good at it with my CDR. Remember this is still beta and
      there will be problems running some games. Enjoy.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Update. I've fixed the color problem, we
      now have keyboard and joystick input. I've added sound, the game
      menu and option menu are working, you can quit a game and play
      another, the speed is very good. I have a build with about 500
      drivers in it and most of them appear to be working. I am doing
      a little Beta testing right at the moment, Christophe Thibault
      of <A HREF="http://mamedc.kaillera.com/">MAMEDC</A> says it works
      &quot;works very very well&quot; and even runs contra for him,
      a special thanks to him, his source code to mamedc saved me a
      bit of time for a couple of things I hadn't bothered to finish
      yet. I'll see if I can get that's sound support fixed up for
      everyone.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">It's Alive! OK what does this mean. It
      means I should be able to get the full MAME running on Dreamcast
      under KOS. It means you will be able to play all those MAME games,
      well at least those that will run in the limited RAM of the Dreamcast.
      I still have a bunch of work to do but hopefully it won't be
      too much longer before I can release a full working port of MAME
      for Dreamcast. It will be a bit klunky to set up at first but
      I'll do my best to keep it painless. No, it's not MAME32 but
      that's like asking me to port MacMAME to the dreamcast which
      is a really stupid question, you want MAME and you are going
      to get it...and that's all that matters.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Update from <A HREF="http://www.dcemulation.com/">DCEmualtion</A>:
      And to top that off someone else has just release a version of
      <A HREF="http://mamedc.kaillera.com/">MAMEDC</A> for the Dreamcast.
      I haven't tried it but a bit of friendly competition never hurt
      anyone. Note: it doesn't look like it has zipfile support yet
      so try it with the roms unzipped.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Things are progressing, I have the code
      running now right up to just before emulation starts. It crashes
      right afterwards but the roms are loaded and everything is initialized.
      There is no input yet (keyboard or joystick) and the code is
      riddled with debugging code but hopefully those little pesky
      pacman ghosts will appear soon. Yes, I know the color is all
      screwed but who cares at this point anyways. Thanks for all the
      nice supportive e-mails, and as for all those nay say-ers on
      the boards....don't bother downloading it when it's done.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">A little update on my progress for all
      of you. I know it's not much but those of you who have used the
      camera version of MAMED will recognize this screen. There is
      still much work to be done. My MAMED menu system uses much of
      the internal MAME core menu system which in turn uses much of
      the internal MAME core graphics system. So as you can see a lot
      of MAME core code is being used to get to this point.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">By the way we've reached a quarter million
      visitors. Thanks. That's quite a milestone, I know the rest of
      the download counters and statistics are broken right now. Hopefully
      they can get them working again soon.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Well it's been a while. I've moved and
      I have a new job and a new home but overall things are going
      quite well. It's time for something new.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Announcing Multipac for Dreamcast available
      from the <A HREF="download.htm">download</A> page. You will notice
      this device also begins with the letter &quot;D&quot;. I guess
      it's just a coincidence. It currently runs under KOS and requires
      the command line keyboard interface to select the game rom and
      has no sound but you really don't want me spending lots of time
      on multipac do you.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I tried doing some dreamcast stuff earlier
      but the GCC compiler for the dreamcast just wasn't up to the
      task but now I think it's ready. Special thanks for Toodles help
      and <A HREF="http://www.toodles.org/dchowto.html">how to page</A>
      and to Gansoft's for hosting the <A HREF="http://www.ganksoft.com/">DC
      Tonic CD</A> so I could finally download a working compiler and
      to <A HREF="http://dcdev.allusion.net/">Dan Potter</A> for his
      nice little <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cadcdev/">KallistiOS</A>.
      I hope to be able to port some of the other code bases I am familiar
      with and maybe a few new ones too.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Don't even ask me how to make a bootable
      CD because I can't even make one with cdrecord and my CDR. You
      can find plenty of help at <A HREF="http://www.dcemulation.com/">DCEmu</A>
      on how to make bootable CD's. If someone want's to send me some
      bootable DJ/Nero images without roms, I'd be happy to put them
      up. Of course without the keyboard and using init.klf it will
      only run mspacman because I do not have a controller menu for
      selecting roms, only keyboard.</FONT></P>
