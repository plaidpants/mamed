      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Just a little Christmas present for all
      you MAMED fans.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">MAMED version 36b11b is now available and
      has much improved sound on the DC265, it's still too slow and
      choppy though, sound is also still disabled on the DC290. I also
      added in a startup sound so you can tell when the camera is finished
      loading MAMED. That's about it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I received my beta version of the new <A
      HREF="http://www.flashpoint.com/about/press/1999/11/17.html">Digita
      OS application SDK</A> recently, I will be converting my build
      enviroment over to the new enviroment as soon as possible. It
      uses Tornado 2.0 but hopefully there will not be too many makefile
      changes.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">MAMED was featured in the December 1999
      issue of the Japanese magazine <A HREF="http://www.syscom.co.jp/">Famitsu
      Wave</A>. I bet people can't wait until I can port a GameBoy
      emulator so you can all play Pokemon on your camera's.</FONT></P>
      <P><A HREF="http://www.flashpoint.com/"><FONT FACE="Arial">Flashpoint</FONT></A><FONT
       FACE="Arial"> also started offering online a couple new Digita
      OS applications <A HREF="http://www.flashpoint.com/products/digitaFile.html">Digita
      File</A> and <A HREF="http://www.flashpoint.com/products/digitaPresents.html">Digita
      Presents</A>. Digita File is a free update to the version that
      shipped with the DC290 camera and is availble free from FlashPoint's
      web site, but it is only availble for the DC290. Digita Presents
      is a nice slideshow and presentation application for the DC290
      and can be ordered online. I am also featured in the FlashPoint
      Digita Developer Spotlight along with my friend Scott Angel.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also, <A HREF="http://www.zophar.net/personal/lopantu/int11999.html">here</A>
      is another interview of me I completely forgot to mention on

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">New MAMED version 36b10b is available that
      supports sound on the DC265, sound is currently disabled on the
      DC290, support is comming soon. Special thanks to my friend Scott
      Angel for writing the sound code. Sound would not have been possible
      without his help. Also thanks to XMAME project whose sound source
      code we used extensively on top of our lower level sound code.
      Sound is not perfect but it's a start.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I also received a copy of the December
      1999 <A HREF="http://www.futurenet.com/edge/">EDGE</A> magazine
      from the UK with a big picture of MAMED running on my camera.
      Thanks.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">New version 36b91b available that supports
      high resolution games. There is also a game options menu for
      quick selection of pad orientation and display rotation. Slightly
      different set of games supported, as usual. Used a larger font
      for better reading but it gets small in high resolutiuon mode.
      This version is based on 36b91b version of MAME source code.
      The new MAME licence agreement requires that MAMED have the same
      version number as the MAME code it was based on, thus the new
      version number.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Sound is not implemented in this version
      but here is an update for you. Sound code is coming along well,
      it finally sounds right, thanks to XMAME, the unix version of
      MAME. It's still is choppy due to some low level driver digita
      issues which we are going to have to rewrite to correct. Hopefully
      soon.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">I am working on the memory issues and I
      finally have some working test code by reconstructing the system
      symbol table. Now that I've got the high resolution and rotation
      stuff working I will try and cut up MAME in nice easy chunks
      that I can load and link together nicely. Some of the game drivers
      are cross linked so it's not so easy to find the best way to
      break them all up.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Sorry this last release took so long, had
      a little partition corruption problem on the PC after trying
      to install Linux. The MAMED source code was safe, but my MAME
      drive was toast though. Oh well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Enjoy.</FONT></P>

      for Digita to MAMED to conform to the new derivative works section
      found in the MAME documentation. Please refer to this version

      original version of MAME.</FONT></P>

      so you can at least run pacman. This version also brings the
