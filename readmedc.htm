    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you have never used MAME you might want
    to learn how to use it first on the PC before trying to play
    MAME on your dreamcast. You can experiment with operating the
    emulator a little more easily there than you can doing it on
    the dreamcast.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">1. How to burn a MAMED Dreamcast CD:</FONT></B><FONT
     FACE="Arial"><BR>
<BR>
    Burning a CD that you can play on the dreamcast is not an easy
    thing to do. Sega really didn't want people to find out about
    this so they made it extremely difficult so don't expect to succeed
    on your first try (go out and buy a BIG stack of blank CD's).
    MAMED for dreamcast was developed without any support from Sega
    and contains no Sega software.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The easiest way is to make the CD is to
    download the MAMED Disk Juggler CD image and use DJ to write
    the CD. This is a very large download (25MB+) and you may want
    to use a download manager to get the file. The image is compressed
    using WinRAR which has a nice feature of being able to repair
    the archive if it is slightly damaged during the transfer. You
    can download a demo version of WinRAR <A HREF="http://www.rarsoft.com/">here</A>.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The DJ software is available for free from
    the <A HREF="http://www.padus.com/">Padus</A> web site but the
    demo version only writes using the slowest speed available on
    your recorder. Not all recorders are supported, especially when
    trying to write this very special dreamcast CD format. You should
    use the latest version of the DJ software because previous versions
    may have trouble on some recorders. I was able to burn the MAMED
    CD image without trouble on my really old Memorex 2x recorder
    using the default settings with DJ v3.00.783 but others have
    reported that you must use the &quot;raw write&quot; setting
    in the advanced tab in order for it to burn correctly using their
    recorder. If it does not work with your recorder you may need
    to use Nero instead.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To burn the MAMED CD image using Nero you
    must first convert the DJ image to the nero image format using
    cdi2nero available <A HREF="http://cdirip.freeyellow.com/index_en.htm">here</A>.
    Nero, like DJ, has a free demo version available from <A HREF="http://www.ahead.de/">Ahead
    Software</A>.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To burn the MAMED CD image on the macintosh
    you need DC Mac Pack 4.0 and Toast. Run CDIRip from Mac Pack
    4.0 and select the DJ image. It will result 2 data tracks. Burn
    the 2 tracks as the Mac Pack says with TOAST. Select CD-ROM XA
    and drag the first track on the window. Write the session and
    then close the window. Select CD-ROM XA again and drag the second
    track on the window and then choose write CD. Note: the current
    CDIRip doesn't support the latest DJ images but mainly version
    2 and early version 3.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">If you have followed the above instructions
    correctly the MAMED CD should boot in your dreamcast and display
    a list of MAMED packs. Each pack contains drivers to run certain
    games. The dreamcast has very limited RAM compared to a modern
    PC so I had to break the MAME program up into smaller pieces
    that could run on the dreamcast. But this still only allows the
    smaller games to run. You can scroll up and down to pick a pack
    and then press the red &quot;A&quot; button to select and run
    it. You should now see a menu with &quot;RESCAN&quot; and &quot;EXIT&quot;.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The MAMED DJ CD image available on this
    site does not come with and games on it. You must make a second
    CD with the roms required to run a game. MAME works by emulating
    the actual circuit board inside the arcade machine. The circuit
    board contains computer chips, some of which contain copyrighted
    software code. The contents of these rom chips must be supplied
    by you because MAMED does not contain and copyrighted roms. Do
    not ask me for information on where to find roms, you will be
    ignored. Also, please do not distribute MAMED with any roms.
    Remember that the roms for MAME change slightly sometimes from
    version to version, so be sure the MAME roms you are using match
    the base version of MAMED for dreamcast you are using.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">To make a roms CD, burn an ordinary iso
    with all your zipped MAME roms in the root directory or in a
    &quot;/roms/&quot; directory. You can also put PNG files in a
    &quot;/snap/&quot; directory that match the rom names and they
    will be display in the game list. Most of the standard MAME directories
    can go here without problem (&quot;/samples/&quot;, &quot;/cfg/&quot;)
    but some have not been tested. Simply swap the CD in the dreamcast
    and select &quot;RESCAN&quot; from the menu.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">You can also burn a CD that contains both
    the roms and the MAMED program using the self boot kit available
    on this site. You must still provide your own roms but everything
    can be put on one self boot CD. Simply follow the instructions
    contained in the self boot kit.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">2. Using MAMED for Dreamcast:</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Once you have booted the MAMED CD and selected
    a pack you then swap in your roms CD and select rescan. A list
    of game rom names should appear. Using the first joystick connected
    to the dreamcast you can use the directional to scroll up and
    down and page up and down the game list and select the game you
    wish to play. If you select &quot;EXIT&quot; you will return
    to the pack selection menu. There is also an options menu which
    can be used to change some game parameters. This options menu
    is different than the standard MAME in game menu because it allows
    you to specify options that are normally only available from
    the command line in the PC version of MAME. You get to the game
    options menu from the game rom list by pressing the left trigger
    on the first joystick. To toggle a selection press &quot;A&quot;.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Game Options</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">-Pad Orientation<BR>
    This option doesn't do anything and is something from the camera
    version of MAMED.<BR>
    -Resolution<BR>
    This option allows you to select between different resolutions.
    This is useful to be able to play games like rampage which use
    a high resolution screen. It is also useful to have enough pixels
    to display games rotated vertically and still be able to see
    all the pixels. Experiment with this option to find the resolution
    you like the best.<BR>
    -No Rotation<BR>
    -Rotation Right<BR>
    -Rotation Left<BR>
    -Flip X<BR>
    -Flip Y<BR>
    These are all MAME options for display to adjust which way is
    up for game and system graphics. You can experiment to find which
    option works best for you for which game or system.<BR>
    -Sound<BR>
    This enables sound MAME, but it can be disabled with the fake
    sound option.<BR>
    -Samples<BR>
    This enables sound samples that are required for some ROMs. Place
    the samples in the samples directory on the roms CD. This can
    be disabled by the fake sound option.<BR>
    -Fake Sound<BR>
    This disables sound at the low level so MAME can think sound
    is running. Some ROMs require sound to be enabled to operate
    properly. This can be used to disable sound without affecting
    these ROMs.<BR>
    -Artwork<BR>
    Just put the artwork files in the artwork directory.<BR>
    -CPU Slice Speedup<BR>
    Some game drivers have exceeding high number of CPU context switches
    when they really don't require so many. This option reduces the
    number of context switches to exactly 1 per frame. This may not
    work on some driver and may crash others but on the few it does
    work on you can expect a dramatic speed boost. (try Xevious,
    Dig Dug and Galaga for example)<BR>
    -Auto Rotate<BR>
    Detect the orientation of the game and rotate the screen and
    directional to match. You'll need to rotate your TV vertically
    for vertical games. Really useful when running in a camera, no
    so useful when playing on a TV.<BR>
    -Dirty Rects<BR>
    Dirty rects option allows the video code to only update the parts
    of the screen that have changed and can improve video performance.
    You can force this option on or off or only turn it on for drivers
    that support dirty rects<BR>
    -Hide Clones<BR>
    Clones can clutter up the game rom list so you can turn them
    off here. You need to rescan to see the results. Also remember
    some games like neogeo games are all clones so if you turn them
    off you will not see and games.<BR>
    -Memory Gauge<BR>
    You can't really select anything here but it will let you know
    what the current and maximum memory usage is during the current
    session.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">After you have selected a game from the
    game list it will be loaded into memory and run. If the game
    does not run and returns to the game list there was and error.
    Some games are simply too big to run, even some games which have
    small roms may require even more memory for emulating ram or
    sound and video HW. Don't expect a game to run even if it has
    a small rom. You may be trying to use a rom which is for a different
    version of MAME than this version of MAMED for dreamcast was
    based on. This <A HREF="http://www.sys2064.com/fixfiles.htm">site</A>
    may help you discover what roms have changed for different versions
    of MAME. The game may also be broken either due to a bug in my
    code or something in the MAME core. Don't worry, I'll fix it
    as soon as I can. You can check the <A HREF="http://www.chez.com/omc1/MAMED/Index.htm">MAMEd
    compatibility and performance reports</A> for a list of known
    working games.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The first thing you should see is the MAME
    information screen. Use the joystick to press OK if you do not
    have a keyboard by pressing left and then right on the first
    joystick connected to the dreamcast. After you have dismissed
    all the information screens the game will start running and you
    can play it.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">MAMED supports up to four joysticks connected
    to your dreamcast so you can play games that require four joysticks.
    If a keyboard is connect it can also be used. All the joysticks
    are mapped to keys on the keyboard and are not considered real
    joysticks in the MAME core. This is because of a significant
    performance loss if I do it the other way. You can reassign all
    keys and joystick buttons using the MAME core in game menu system.
    Many features are available with the MAME core in game menu system
    and I won't bother to list them all here, feel free to experiment
    a bit with it.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Each joystick corresponds to a MAME player.
    So pressing start on joystick 2 is the same as pressing the 2
    player start in a game. So in a game such a galaxian which has
    only one joystick which is shared between two players, you must
    press the start button on the second joystick to play a 2 player
    game of galaxian even though you would share the 1st joystick
    in actual play.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The joystick buttons A, X, B &amp; Y correspond
    to joystick player buttons 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4. The right trigger
    is the coin switch corresponding to the joystick player. The
    left trigger on the first joystick is mapped to the &quot;TAB&quot;
    key and will allow access to the MAME core in game menu system.
    To generate an &quot;ESC&quot; without the keyboard press A,
    B, X, Y &amp; Start on the first joystick all at the same time
    and then release. This will return you to the game list menu
    and stop emulating the game. There are still some memory leaks
    in the code when quiting a game and this will cause trouble when
    trying to run large games or many games without rebooting. You
    can check out the memory gauge in the game options menu available
    from the game rom list. Remember some games can be deceptive
    in their memory usage, for example vector games take a lot of
    ram because of some rather large anti-alias tables that are created
    when the game is loaded. Vector games also take a long time to
    load also because those anti-alias tables are made using a lot
    of floating point calculations.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">3. Other tips and tricks:</FONT></B></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Remember to have the neogeo bios rom on
    the roms disk to run neogeo roms. This goes for other games too
    that are clones. You must have the parent rom and the clone rom
    on the roms CD for it to run. So if you have a MAME roms CD that
    is sorted aphabetically you may be missing a parent rom that
    is named completely differently from the clone rom that might
    be on a different roms CD.</FONT></P>
